# IP Banlist generator file for B3 banlist plugin

The banlist plugin can read external banlists and enforce the bans on your server as well.

This example version of banlist.php creates an IP banlist for you to share with other admins.

You can use this file to enforce IP bans instead of GUID bans  using the banlist plugin.
Find the plugin here: https://github.com/thomasleveil/b3-plugin-banlist

## usage

1. open and edit the banlist.php file with the credentials to connect to your B3 database
2. upload the file to a php enabled webserver
3. make sure that banlist.php can access the database from its location!
4. share the address of the banlist with other admins

## notes

If you ned support for the banlist plugin go to the appropriate section of the B3 forums.

This section of the code is mearly an example on how this plugin can cooperate with the banlist plugin on IP based bans.
